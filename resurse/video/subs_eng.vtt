1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.760
so i've spent the last five and a half

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.679
months collecting and testing

3
00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.200
all the top globally available

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.200
smartphones i've rated every single ones

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.519
performance camera battery and display

6
00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.280
based on what price it's selling for and

7
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.360
giving them an overall value rating

8
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.120
so with that in mind these are the top

9
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.039
22 smartphones in the world right now

10
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.240
from good to better to the best some of

11
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.600
these will surprise you

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.920
okay so at the back end is nokia

13
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.599
specifically the x20

14
00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.000
which is their affordable flagship 2021

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.359
phone and

16
00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.800
nokia's doing a lot of great stuff right

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.040
now their phones are all inexpensive

18
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.800
they're bloatware free nokia gives

19
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.320
extended warranties and loads of

20
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.000
software support their entire angle is

21
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.040
sustainability

22
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.760
smartphones that you buy and you keep it

23
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.280
really is an admirable message

24
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.039
but i think they focused a little too

25
00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.800
much on this at the cost of

26
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.960
how capable their phones actually are

27
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.239
like for this x20

28
00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.000
their marketing doesn't even mention a

29
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.360
single specification

30
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.600
that's like applying to university but

31
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.760
refusing to show them your grades

32
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.840
and fundamentally it's because this

33
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.520
phone is absolutely crushed

34
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.960
by even the cheaper phones from

35
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.199
companies like xiaomi so

36
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.320
b minus and then we've got samsung they

37
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.320
recently came out with the a52

38
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.000
which is like their mid-range flagship

39
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.600
of the year and there's nothing

40
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.640
inherently wrong with it

41
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.720
it's a fun design it's pleasant to use

42
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.960
but it costs too much for what it is

43
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.159
it's pretty clear that all samsung's

44
00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.680
done is taken one of their top end

45
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.159
phones

46
00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.360
and made everything a bit worse but for

47
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.159
500

48
00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.080
in today's market you can nearly buy

49
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.600
yourself an actual flagship

50
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.520
so you don't need to make this kind of

51
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.439
compromise do you remember the oppo find

52
00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.400
x3 pro

53
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.040
the company's 2021 flagship that looks a

54
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.640
little too close to the iphone for it to

55
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.680
be a coincidence

56
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.240
well there's plenty to like about it

57
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.560
it's supremely comfortable for starters

58
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.320
thanks to being made of one continuous

59
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.240
sheet of glass and that microscope

60
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.520
camera on the back is

61
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.040
it's unlike anything i've ever seen on a

62
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.640
phone before but

63
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.799
the main issue and this seems to happen

64
00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.479
every year is that as soon as oppo

65
00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.759
launches a flagship phone

66
00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.759
it is pretty much destroyed and valued

67
00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.759
by oneplus flagship that launches a

68
00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:02.799
month later

69
00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.159
both companies use very similar

70
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.159
components and materials and they are

71
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.000
good components and materials but

72
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.280
the fact that this phone is selling at

73
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.560
the equivalent of fifteen hundred

74
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.120
dollars

75
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.760
makes it much less good for the money

76
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.160
and

77
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.319
that's actually a pretty great segue on

78
00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.440
to our next phone

79
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.280
so we're getting pretty used to the idea

80
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.879
of paying over a thousand dollars for a

81
00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.239
top-end flagship right

82
00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.840
but zte has something to say about that

83
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.959
yeah zte they are still making phones

84
00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.760
but the ax130 ultra genuinely is worth

85
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.640
talking about

86
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.000
because it has the highest end

87
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.280
snapdragon 888 chipset a 144 hertz

88
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.040
refresh rate amoled display

89
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.720
big battery fast charging stereo

90
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.319
speakers really everything

91
00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.000
and it even looks an awful lot like

92
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.160
samsung's note 20 ultra which is

93
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.239
not a taller criticism and most

94
00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.200
significantly

95
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.800
i'm told this is going to cost 800

96
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.120
excuse me i was having a whale of a time

97
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.319
with it

98
00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.800
until i tested the cameras and they

99
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.560
really revealed just how much progress

100
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.920
the competition has made

101
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.360
everything from the interface to the

102
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.680
image processing feels really behind

103
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.200
i'll reserve final judgement until

104
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.720
updates drop because

105
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.400
this camera hardware should be better

106
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.800
than this but in its current state

107
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.360
it's a b and thanks to surfsharkvpn for

108
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.879
sponsoring this video

109
00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.000
okay the iphone 12 mini what is it

110
00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.920
has not been a commercial hit when apple

111
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.200
first came out and announced that they

112
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.519
built a fully flagship 5g iphone that

113
00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.959
literally fits into your palm

114
00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.040
i think a lot of us thought whoa that's

115
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.959
gonna fly off the shelves

116
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.640
but it didn't according to research

117
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.720
firms this phone only made up about five

118
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.720
to seven percent of total iphone 12

119
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.000
sales

120
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.840
but that doesn't mean it's a bad phone i

121
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.040
think the reason it didn't sell well is

122
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.280
because a the price is so close to the

123
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.040
much bigger iphone 12

124
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.280
combined with b the apple has kind of

125
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.799
built an association between their

126
00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:53.760
smaller phones

127
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.840
being their cheaper phones which may

128
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.280
have created the perception that the 12

129
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.840
mini was an

130
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.319
inferior product but really it is the

131
00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.080
same speedy experience with a great

132
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.360
camera as the 12

133
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.519
that i can recommend to any iphone fan

134
00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.439
who doesn't need a power user's level of

135
00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.400
battery life

136
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.480
okay now we're getting on to the really

137
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.879
good phones the rog phone 5

138
00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.959
is a beast it's the highest performing

139
00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.320
smartphone i've used today

140
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.839
it's six thousand milliamp hour battery

141
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.918
is ludicrous actually earning it the

142
00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:22.400
best battery phones so far in 2021

143
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.720
and its speakers are so punchy that you

144
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.000
will want to stop whatever it is you're

145
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.560
doing

146
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.400
and just lose yourself in them its only

147
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.840
problem comes from the fact that

148
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.400
it's a pretty specialized device like it

149
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.080
takes a certain kind of user to want to

150
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.880
carry a phone

151
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.440
of such monumental proportions tolerate

152
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.440
some slightly outdated looking bezels

153
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.280
and use a camera system that feels

154
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.040
noticeably lacking but if you are that

155
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.840
user then

156
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.919
bob's your uncle but what kind of

157
00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.759
surprised me almost as much as phone

158
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.600
number one is going to surprise you

159
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.280
is that even though asus has been

160
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.960
dominating the gaming space for a while

161
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.759
now

162
00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.199
i don't think they're the best value

163
00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.240
anymore enter the lenovo legion phone

164
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.720
dual 2. it almost exactly matches the

165
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.960
rog in specs but you get 50

166
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.840
more ram and 100 more storage by default

167
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.680
it has fans built inside of it instead

168
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.520
of needing this external attachment

169
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.479
and somehow it's cheaper the hardware on

170
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.400
this phone is so good for the money that

171
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.639
they can't be making a lot of profit but

172
00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.320
it is a little let down on the software

173
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.800
front

174
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.800
like the camera image processing isn't

175
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.080
getting the best out of the camera

176
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.360
hardware you have here

177
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.680
still though this is an a-grade phone

178
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.440
and is also the winner of

179
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.759
best gaming phone on the market right

180
00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:30.880
now okay

181
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.560
you might remember from my best phones

182
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.080
of 2020 video that

183
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.759
one of the winners was a bit of a

184
00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.560
surprise the zenfone 7 pro

185
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.320
it was just this no-nonsense combination

186
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.560
of a great price huge battery

187
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.560
seamless uninterrupted screen and a

188
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.479
capable camera that can also double as

189
00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.320
basically the greatest selfie machine of

190
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.280
all time

191
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.160
well this is basically the successor to

192
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.639
that

193
00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.080
so as you can probably imagine it's a

194
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.479
very good phone but it's no longer one

195
00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.199
of the best

196
00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.800
simply because all they've done is taken

197
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800
last year's zenfone 7 and given it a

198
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.160
slight spec bump

199
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.600
and that's just not enough against

200
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600
companies who are really pushing

201
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.280
still though i'm willing to bet that if

202
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.199
you ever get to try this selfie camera

203
00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.479
it is so good that you have to smile

204
00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.800
alrighty you might remember my video on

205
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.600
this guy the vivo x60 pro plus

206
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.440
to be honest i've used a decent amount

207
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.039
of vivo devices over the years

208
00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.960
and i've always liked them but i've

209
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.160
never really loved them

210
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.840
they kind of developed a reputation for

211
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.000
a garish software overlay and crazy

212
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.520
levels of skin beautification in the

213
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.080
cameras

214
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.479
but the viva x60 pro plus is the first

215
00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:33.600
viva phone i've used

216
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.880
that understands sophistication did i

217
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.039
just change my entire outfit to film one

218
00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.400
sentence

219
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.639
maybe aesthetically it treads the line

220
00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.479
well between looking fashionable

221
00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.560
and looking like it means business and

222
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.919
everything from the gaming performance

223
00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:49.120
to the camera performance

224
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.360
is very close to the best you can buy

225
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.199
and it helps that the camera is just

226
00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.560
super fun to use

227
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.639
too it's slightly let down by a mono

228
00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:57.599
speaker and

229
00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:59.520
middle of the line battery but that

230
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.280
doesn't stop me loving it

231
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.120
number 13. this could be an unlucky one

232
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.390
again

233
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.450
[Music]

234
00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.960
fashion fruit it's the iphone 12 pro

235
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.120
this is a great phone but the reason

236
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.400
that it's not higher up on the list is

237
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.720
that

238
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.720
the way i see it it's just an optional

239
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.160
extra to the 12.

240
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.000
it offers a few fairly minor features

241
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.360
like a lidar scanner for better

242
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.319
augmented reality

243
00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.080
and a two times telephoto lens i

244
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.080
appreciate these but for the majority of

245
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.759
consumers the only notable difference

246
00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:31.599
will be the extra storage it comes with

247
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:33.440
the fact that it's heavier and the fact

248
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.800
that it has a matte finish

249
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.800
it's basically the iphone to get if you

250
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.800
want to spend a bit more than the base

251
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.800
but you don't want to get the max sized

252
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.400
one and that leads me

253
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.720
onto the base iphone 12 because this

254
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.879
phone hugely benefits by how similar it

255
00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:48.160
is to the 12 pro

256
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.080
you know just before they launched i was

257
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.919
using both these phones at the same time

258
00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.840
and i couldn't even tell you how many

259
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.360
moments i had where i'd pick one off the

260
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:55.919
table

261
00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.919
use it for a good five minutes only to

262
00:07:57.919 --> 00:07:58.960
realize

263
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.039
i picked the wrong one up this phone is

264
00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:02.800
just as powerful the screen is almost

265
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.520
identical

266
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.000
you still get all the same ios features

267
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.560
it's just

268
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.960
200 cheaper the only reason this isn't

269
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.240
higher up on the list is that

270
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.319
it only comes with a 60 hertz display

271
00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:13.680
versus 120 or

272
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.400
the 144 we've started seeing now and it

273
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.720
only starts with 64 gigs of storage

274
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.240
which is going to end up being more like

275
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.160
50 by the time you factored in the size

276
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.639
of the operating system so still an a

277
00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.360
grade

278
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.479
and just above that i would put samsung

279
00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:30.960
space flagships

280
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.120
[Music]

281
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.399
there we go the s21 and s21 plus are not

282
00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:37.679
the most exciting devices

283
00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.440
they don't do anything particularly new

284
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.279
or groundbreaking in fact in a lot of

285
00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:41.679
ways

286
00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.440
they're a complete side grade from last

287
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.959
year's s20 phones

288
00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:47.360
but they bring in a lot of smaller

289
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.040
quality of life improvements

290
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.640
they've had a redesign that takes them

291
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.240
from some of the worst looking flagships

292
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.000
to some of the best in my books

293
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.080
and in a bit of a surprise turn of

294
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.279
events

295
00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.600
they're cheaper than last year's okay

296
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.720
we're in the top 10.

297
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.080
and if you are enjoying this video then

298
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.760
a sub to the channel would be

299
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.680
mighty i realized that for the last

300
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.959
month over 50

301
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:09.440
of you watching have been subscribed so

302
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.720
thank you

303
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.519
this is the xiaomi me 11. it's great

304
00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.519
it's cheaper than the base s21

305
00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:17.680
in just about every region but the us

306
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.680
and spec wise it's more of a match for

307
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.320
the galaxy s21 plus which is two hundred

308
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.680
dollars more than that

309
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.720
[Music]

310
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.480
the best way to think about the mi 11 is

311
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.320
there's a high-end flagship all around

312
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.720
with the best in-class display the only

313
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.640
potential hurdle is xiaomi's miui

314
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.120
software skin which to be honest i like

315
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.640
but i've showed it to enough people who

316
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.160
don't to know that

317
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.399
not everyone does and just above the

318
00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.480
me11 is

319
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.120
not today milo then we've got the

320
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.000
oneplus 9

321
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.680
now this phone had a bit of a rough

322
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.360
launch i think what happened is that

323
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.440
oneplus basically spent an entire month

324
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.800
before it came out

325
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.160
hyping up their collaboration with

326
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.680
hasselblad giving us never-ending

327
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.800
teasers about how it was going to

328
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.160
revolutionize photography

329
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.279
but then when the phones actually

330
00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.440
arrived hasselblad might as well not

331
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.399
have been involved

332
00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:06.880
you couldn't tell and so justifiably

333
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.240
most reviewers came down

334
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.000
pretty hard on this but a few weeks

335
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.160
later i got a call from oneplus

336
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.200
they said we watched your camera

337
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.720
comparison we took your feedback on

338
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.519
board

339
00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.200
and we've improved them don't get me

340
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.800
wrong this didn't immediately make it a

341
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.920
dream camera system

342
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.079
but for its price now it is a good

343
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:23.920
camera system and even without optical

344
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.040
image stabilization

345
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.760
it takes crisp smooth video plus of

346
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.200
course being a oneplus phone

347
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.959
you get fast bloat free software with

348
00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:32.720
guaranteed updates it's a little more

349
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.800
focused on exactly what the user needs

350
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.959
with no unnecessary extras and because

351
00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:38.399
of this they've managed to keep to their

352
00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.600
tradition of staying

353
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.519
more affordable than their competitors

354
00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:42.959
definitely a grade phone

355
00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:44.880
then we've got the oneplus 9 pro which

356
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.000
is the 9's more

357
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.920
expensive counterpart and the reason

358
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.279
it's above it is that if you have the

359
00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.079
budget

360
00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:52.000
it's worth it it's basically the oneplus

361
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.519
9 but with all those little bits that

362
00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.560
had to be trimmed

363
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.880
put back into it it's not quite an

364
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.800
ultraphone but it is a fully fleshed out

365
00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.519
flagship

366
00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:02.000
and in my eyes the best flagship phone

367
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.440
under one thousand dollars

368
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.000
okay we can't make a list of the best

369
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.560
phones

370
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.839
without including the pixel 4a it was

371
00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:12.240
google's mid-range phone from 2020

372
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.600
and i usually try and refrain from

373
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.440
recommending last year's options when a

374
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.360
new one may well be around the corner

375
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.519
but given that this is available now for

376
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:21.519
299 dollars compared to

377
00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:24.240
3.49 it was launched at given that it's

378
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.240
only gotten better since it launched and

379
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:26.560
the

380
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.480
because it's a google made phone it'll

381
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.000
most likely still get updates all the

382
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.839
way till android 14.

383
00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:33.279
i wouldn't hesitate in still

384
00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:35.680
recommending it the pixel 4a

385
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.920
should not be as good as it is no part

386
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.200
of this phone's spec sheet

387
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.360
is impressive in 2021 but it's just

388
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.600
carried by phenomenal software

389
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.040
not to mention it's a really enjoyable

390
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.279
size the bezels are nice and even

391
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:49.120
and it's powerful enough that i don't

392
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.040
think you'll be worrying about speed

393
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.519
but as much as i do like the pixel i'd

394
00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:54.880
be lying if i said that that was the

395
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.639
best compact phone you can get

396
00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:58.800
because that award goes to the zenfone

397
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.399
8. you might remember how i

398
00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:02.160
completely grilled the way it looks in

399
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
my full review and i stand by it

400
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.680
but that doesn't change the fact that

401
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.279
like the iphone 12 mini

402
00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:08.800
this is a flagship phone through and

403
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.959
through but unlike that phone

404
00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:13.360
this one has a great battery too this is

405
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.959
pretty much the only small phone

406
00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:16.639
where the fact that it's small has no

407
00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:18.079
negative consequences

408
00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:21.120
so this is an a plus in my books but now

409
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.639
we're on to the big boy phones

410
00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:26.000
in fifth place is the iphone 12 pro max

411
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.360
it's a phone that providing you have the

412
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.600
budget and the palm size

413
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.600
it's an easy win i totally agree that

414
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.040
it's not the most exciting phone in the

415
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.600
world

416
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.040
but the reason that this is still the

417
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.880
main phone i use on a day-to-day basis

418
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.120
is that it's supremely reliable the

419
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.560
combination of ios levels of

420
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.440
optimization

421
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.600
with the best hardware you can get on an

422
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.519
iphone means that if i want to post an

423
00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.480
instagram story

424
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.399
i know it's going to look good if i want

425
00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:49.920
to send a whatsapp voice note

426
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.839
i know it's going to sound good

427
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.240
and the battery is going to reliably get

428
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.079
me through any day i throw at it

429
00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:00.480
also this phone is so strong that it's

430
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.480
the first i've ever used caseless

431
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.399
i've dropped this thing enough times and

432
00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:06.079
seen it come back unscathed enough

433
00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:08.160
times that i just don't worry about it

434
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.839
anymore the only two things that do

435
00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.360
sting a little are the fact that it's

436
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.279
distinctly uncomfortable to hold

437
00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:15.040
and that it's the only phone even close

438
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.800
to this price bracket that doesn't have

439
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.480
a high refresh rate screen

440
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.600
now slightly better than even that is

441
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.880
why is samsung's top end phone i think

442
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.800
the galaxy s21 ultra is genuinely the

443
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.839
most refined

444
00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:29.839
polished device they've ever released

445
00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:31.839
it's a big visual upgrade over the s20

446
00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:32.480
ultra

447
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.800
plus a long list of subtle corrections

448
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.040
which is exactly what that phone needed

449
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.880
it's taken it from incredibly capable

450
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.079
with mixed delivery

451
00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:42.160
to incredibly capable with strong

452
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.760
delivery i like the way it looks

453
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.600
i like the way it feels and providing

454
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.680
you've got a hand big enough to hold it

455
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.279
i have no reservations in recommending

456
00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:51.199
it and that leaves us with the best

457
00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:52.720
overall flagship phone

458
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.480
if money was no object and this award

459
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.279
is going to the xiaomi me 11 ultra i

460
00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.040
could spend 15 minutes straight just

461
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.240
talking about this phone

462
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.000
actually that's what i did a few weeks

463
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.920
ago i'll leave the video linked up here

464
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.399
but fundamentally the summary is this

465
00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:10.000
thing is a nuclear missile

466
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.839
xiaomi looked at what samsung was doing

467
00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:14.000
and built a phone squarely targeted

468
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.040
straight at it

469
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.880
it takes samsung's best features and

470
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.959
one-ups it in almost every aspect

471
00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:21.519
for the same price i wouldn't say it

472
00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:23.600
completely invalidates samsung's s21

473
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.079
ultra

474
00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:25.680
i think this is still a nicer looking

475
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.279
phone i still think this has a more

476
00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:29.440
consistent camera but for a true power

477
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.480
user you just

478
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.320
can't get more than this on a phone so

479
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.000
what on earth can be better than that

480
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.920
well we've got two more phones and

481
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.440
they're not trying to be the highest end

482
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.480
phones you can buy

483
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.320
but they're focused on value and their

484
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.920
value proposition is just so

485
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.279
unbelievably good

486
00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.199
that it makes you want to take a chair

487
00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:47.440
sit down and just have a think

488
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.760
what are other companies doing so in

489
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.880
second place

490
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.519
is the redmi note 10 pro now for those

491
00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:54.480
of you who don't know

492
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.880
redmi is a spin-off brand of xiaomi who

493
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.560
have basically built a reputation for

494
00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.440
one of the highest

495
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.160
spec to price ratios on the market so in

496
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.720
this case we have a 108 megapixel camera

497
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.399
a 120 hertz display 5020 million power

498
00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:09.519
battery

499
00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:12.800
and it's 279 this thing is

500
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.120
stupid levels of value it does have ads

501
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.160
in the software but

502
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.240
you can turn them off and i mean look

503
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.600
these are the kinds of photos i'm taking

504
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.399
on this phone

505
00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:23.120
it's not even funny don't get me wrong

506
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.480
you will know when you're using it that

507
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.240
it's not a thousand dollar flagship

508
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.720
but it outperforms its price so severely

509
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.360
that

510
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.440
i'm gonna have to give this an a plus

511
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.199
plus in terms of value

512
00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:34.720
and that leaves us with number one the

513
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.040
most worth it phone of 2021

514
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.800
and i guess by implication the most

515
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.720
worth it phone to have ever released

516
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.160
it's the poco f3 just like redmi poco is

517
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.759
yet another value-centric spin-off

518
00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:48.880
company of xiaomi

519
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.399
but the difference with this phone is

520
00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.759
that it's less about camera and it's

521
00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:52.399
more about

522
00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:55.600
processing power so in this case for 350

523
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.240
you get a 120 hertz amoled display you

524
00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.639
get

525
00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:01.839
a 4 520 milliamp hour battery but

526
00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:03.519
the kind of crown jewel here is a

527
00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:05.600
snapdragon 870 chip

528
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.040
it's not the absolute bleeding edge you

529
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.120
can get but it's an overclocked version

530
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.079
of last year's flagship 865. for this

531
00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:12.560
price

532
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.720
that is ridiculous levels of performance

533
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.199
it makes the google pixel 4a look like

534
00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:19.199
it belongs in a museum and while this

535
00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:21.440
isn't google pixel quality software

536
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.720
no amount of software is going to change

537
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.040
the fact that it's twice as powerful

538
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.240
and i think what makes this phone

539
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.079
particularly impressive is the fact that

540
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:30.240
it takes more than a cursory glance to

541
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.160
even realize that it's not a flagship

542
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.560
it still has a glass back it still has

543
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.759
decent haptics

544
00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:37.759
and it's just crazy that i can play the

545
00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:39.279
most demanding games on the entire

546
00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:40.320
android platform

547
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.720
at nearly their highest settings on a

548
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.240
phone that costs barely a quarter

549
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.880
of what the highest n1's do and so the

550
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.959
poco f3 earns not just my best

551
00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:51.120
affordable phone award but also my

552
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.240
overall best

553
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.079
value phone award if you wanted to go

554
00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:57.040
even cheaper you can get the poco m3 pro

555
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.360
which is fantastic value or something

556
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.680
like the real me 8 for 200

557
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.160
but my general recommendation is that if

558
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.919
you can try to spend a bit more

559
00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:08.720
you will get a lot more okay couple of

560
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.599
things to mention here

561
00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.160
there's been no lg on this list because

562
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.119
sad to say but

563
00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.640
lg has finally left the smartphone

564
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.880
market there's been no sony on this list

565
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.240
because at the time of filming they

566
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.240
haven't quite launched their next xperia

567
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:20.959
1 mark

568
00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:23.599
iii and also to be honest thus far i

569
00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.839
have not tested a single sony phone that

570
00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.000
i thought for a mainstream market was

571
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.280
better than the competition

572
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.200
but open to changing my mind on that in

573
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.039
the future though and finally i decided

574
00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:35.120
to keep foldables out of this video too

575
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.520
just because as a category of phones i

576
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.360
feel like they're much harder to rank

577
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.840
under the same criteria okay here's

578
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.280
something to think about for a second

579
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.440
your location your operating system

580
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.960
every hardware detail of the device

581
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.679
you're on right now

582
00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:49.039
as well as all your past browsing

583
00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:50.880
history these are things that

584
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.880
you'd want to keep to yourself right

585
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.720
well this is how much information a

586
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.480
website immediately knows about you the

587
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.600
second you click on it

588
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.039
and to be honest if it's a website you

589
00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:00.880
trust then it's fine

590
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.320
but there's probably a fair few that you

591
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.840
visit that you wouldn't want to know

592
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.320
this

593
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.400
and that's where surfsharkvpn comes in

594
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.600
as far as i've seen it's the most

595
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.120
affordable way to keep yourself

596
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:09.919
anonymous

597
00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:11.760
it's just over two dollars a month for

598
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.360
as many people and devices as you want

599
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.640
but there's another perk

600
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.240
because you can effectively pick the

601
00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.760
location that you want your device to

602
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.559
come from

603
00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:21.280
i can for example pick the us and watch

604
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.559
us tv shows

605
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.240
you can effectively have the exclusives

606
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.600
for every single region

607
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.440
without leaving your home like if i want

608
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.880
to watch batman the dark knight

609
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.039
i just switch to canada and i can do

610
00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:32.080
that so

611
00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.360

the best compact phone i've ever used or

618
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.200
for something a bit more chill

619
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.880
20 inventions that i think are

620
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.240
completely next level

621
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.840
